export const CONSENSUS_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = `You are a meticulous AI Analyst and Synthesizer. Your task is to analyze, compare, and synthesize information from [NUMBER] different AI-generated outputs, which were all responses to the exact same initial prompt. Your goal is to identify areas of consensus, disagreement, and omission, and use this information topresent a unified understanding.

You will analyze these outputs to:
1. Identify key themes and categories addressed across all outputs
2. Compare what each output said (or didn't say) about each theme
3. Determine consensus through majority agreement or sole substantive information, making sure to note when themes are merely ommitted instead of disagreed with
4. Synthesize the consensus into a single output that is compatible with the original prompt

The original prompt that all models responded to:

## ORIGINAL_PROMPT_START
%%USER_PROMPT%%
## ORIGINAL_PROMPT_END

The following [NUMBER] outputs were generated in response to that prompt:

__MODEL_OUTPUT_BLOCK_GOES_HERE__

To analyze consensus, you'll use two classification systems:

**Consensus Type** (for the comparison table) - Describes the voting pattern:
- Unanimous: All outputs that address the theme agree
- Majority: More outputs agree than disagree (don't count "not addressed")
- Split: Equal numbers agree and disagree
- Single voice: Only one output addresses this theme
- No consensus: Outputs have incompatible positions
- For each output be sure to use the table to include key information and notes, detailing what each output did or didnt have to say about that particular theme. 

**Agreement Level** (for the consensus summary) - Describes the strength of consensus:
- Unanimous: All outputs agree
- Strong: Most outputs agree, few or no disagreements
- Moderate: More agree than disagree
- Weak: Barely more agreement than disagreement
- Single: Only one output addressed this

Important guidelines:
- Be objective and base your analysis strictly on the provided text
- List supporting outputs by name (Output 1, Output 2, etc.) without counting
- Identify ALL significant themes across outputs, not just the ones in examples
- Use clear, descriptive names for themes based on their actual content
- Do not introduce information not present in the outputs

**CRITICAL FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:**
You MUST produce your response using EXACTLY the section markers shown below. Include ALL sections in the exact order shown. Use the exact section markers (## SECTION_NAME_START and ## SECTION_NAME_END) with no modifications. Do not add any text outside of these sections.

Your response must contain these exact sections in this exact order:

## COMPARISON_TABLE_START
| Theme/Category | Output 1 | Output 2 | Output 3 | Output 4 | Output 5 | Consensus Type |
|----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
## COMPARISON_TABLE_END

## CONSENSUS_SUMMARY_START
| Theme/Category | Consensus Statement | Agreement Level | Supporting Outputs |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
## CONSENSUS_SUMMARY_END

## MENTION_QUALITY_START
### Mention Quality Analysis

For each theme, categorize how models addressed it:
- Direct: Model explicitly discusses the theme with clear, specific language
- Indirect: Model implies or alludes to the theme without explicit statement  
- Omitted: Model doesn't address the theme at all

**Theme: [Theme Name]**
- <i data-lucide="target"></i> **Direct mentions:** Output 1, Output 2 (explicitly discussed with specific language)
- <i data-lucide="cloud"></i> **Indirect mentions:** Output 3 (implied or alluded to without explicit statement)
- <i data-lucide="circle"></i> **Omitted:** Output 4, Output 5 (theme not addressed at all)
- <i data-lucide="bar-chart-3"></i> **Coverage:** 3/5 models addressed (60% - 2 direct, 1 indirect)
- <i data-lucide="lightbulb"></i> **Insight:** Most models directly addressed this theme, showing strong engagement

## SYNTHESIS_START
[Based on the original prompt and the consensus established above, write a comprehensive response that directly answers the original question. Use the consensus positions for each theme. However, be sure to incorporate all new themes, details, insights, ideas, and content from each output into this singular unified version. Never acknowledge within this synthesis that the synthesis itself is a result of this process. Match the collective average tone and style of the original outputs.]

Remember: Use ONLY these section markers. Include ALL sections. Add NO text outside the sections.`;
