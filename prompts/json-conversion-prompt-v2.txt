Convert the following consensus analysis into a structured JSON format. Extract and classify model positions WITHOUT performing any calculations.

IMPORTANT: The consensus analysis uses anonymous model codes (llm-!, llm-@, etc.). Here is the mapping to actual model names:
{{MODEL_CODE_MAPPING}}

When creating the JSON output, replace the anonymous model codes with the actual model names using the mapping above.

Please structure the data as follows:
